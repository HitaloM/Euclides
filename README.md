# Euclides

> A simple project to learn the basics of Rust.

Euclides is a conceptual calculator that performs all basic and some advanced operations using only addition and subtraction. It handles complex expressions using [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (postfix notation).

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement basic operations
- [ ] Implement advanced/complex operations
- [ ] Graphical User Interface
- [ ] Support infix notation and postfix notation
